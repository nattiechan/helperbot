Proof-of-Concept Chrome extension that manipulates text on screen to make it easier to read.

Co-authored with [Jason Huang](https://github.com/jjhuang3)

----------------------

_v1.0 features:_
- Add the colour gradient to text paragraphs on websites in light mode
- Toggle on/off by clicking the extension icon

----------------------

## Install

Since the extension is only a proof-of-concept, the extension is only available in development mode.

Step 1: Clone the repo to your desired folder in your local environment

```
git clone https://github.com/nattiechan/helperbot.git
```

Step 2: Follow instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked) to load and test the extension on Chrome.

---------------------

_Background:_

The once-available feature in the accessibility chrome extension Helperbird to add the colour gradient to text for ease of reading inspired this 6-hour hackathon project as part of the Codesmith software engineering immersive curriculum.

_Future Possibilities:_

- Revamp colour gradient application logic to apply gradient per sentence
- Add the ability to manipulate text font and line height
- Include a popup page to toggle each functionality individually
- Add the ability to store different selections as favourites
